# Recognizing hand motion patterns using neural networks

This was a project I did in the [Acquisition of Electrophysiological Signals](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/sr-lat/fis/karton_predmeta/13E053AES-2019) during my third year of undergraduate studies in 2019.

The project aimed to use a one-layered neural network as a classificator to recognize and distinguish between five different hand motions. 
The detailed description of the project is available in the .pdf document in Serbian (in the form of a project report).
